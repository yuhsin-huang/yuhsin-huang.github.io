In this post, I will show how to construct an interesting data visualization of the Palmer Penguins data set.

### Retrieve data
First, we will use pandas to retrieve data from the url.

```
import pandas as pd
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilChodrow/PIC16B/master/datasets/palmer_penguins.csv"
penguins = pd.read_csv(url)
```
