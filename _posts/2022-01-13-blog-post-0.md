In this post, I will show how to construct an interesting data visualization of the Palmer Penguins data set.

## Retrieve Data
First, we use pandas to retrieve data from the url.

```
import pandas as pd
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilChodrow/PIC16B/master/datasets/palmer_penguins.csv"
penguins = pd.read_csv(url)
```

## Plot Graph
### 1. Import Matplotlib and Create a Grid
Matplotlib package is a great tool for data visualization. We will import the package and create a grid first.

```
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize = (12, 5))
```

- The second line of code tells that we are going to create two plots side by side, and by using figsize, we can stretch them out.

### 2. Add Data Markers
There are many different types of plots we can make with Matplotlib. In this post, I will show how to create a scatterplot.

```
ax[0].scatter(penguins["Culmen Length (mm)"], 
              penguins["Culmen Depth (mm)"], 
              color = "skyblue", 
              alpha = 0.8)
ax[1].scatter(penguins["Flipper Length (mm)"], 
              penguins["Body Mass (g)"], 
              color = "firebrick",
              alpha = 0.6)

fig
```

- The index after 'ax' is to specify which subplot we are graphing. Then, by adding which data to put on x-axis and y-axis, a simple scatterplot will be generated!
- As shown in the code block above, we can also change the color and transparency (alpha) of the plot. 
- Alpha can be altered in the range of [0, 1]. The larger the alpha is, the more opaque data marks are.
- The last line of code is to call the figure, so that we can see what we have made so far.

### 3. Annotations
It is always important to label axes and add titles to plots. We can do them by doing the following:

```
ax[0].set(xlabel = "Culmen Length (mm)",
          ylabel = "Culmen Depth (mm)",
          title = "Plot 1")

ax[1].set(xlabel = "Flipper Length (mm)",
          ylabel = "Body Mass (g)",
          title = "Plot 2")

fig.suptitle("Graphs of the Palmer Penguins")

fig
```

- "suptitle" is the overall title of the figure, and therefore it will appear in the top center.
