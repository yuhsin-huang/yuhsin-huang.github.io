title: Blog Post 2 - Flask Webapp
---

**In this blog post, I will show how to develop a webapp using the Flask framework.<br/>Our main goal for this post would be to create a simple message bank that allows the users to submit and view messages.**

## ยง1. Setup
**To set up the flask framework, we need to import the following. Additionally, we need to import sqlite3 in order to deal with database.**

```
from flask import Flask, render_template, request, g, redirect, request, url_for
import sqlite3

app = Flask(__name__)
```

## ยง2. Functions for Database Management

**In this part, I will show how to create a database, insert data into the database, and retrieve information from the database.**

**First, we write a function called get_message_db() to handle creating the database of messages.**

```
def get_message_db():
    # connect the database message_db
    if 'db' not in g:
        g.message_db = sqlite3.connect('messages.sqlite')
    
    # create a table if there isn't one in the database, colomns include message_id, handle, and message
    # after the column name, specify the data type and constraints
    # not null means that the column does not accept NULL value, and primary key means that the value must be unique
    cmd = \
    "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS messages(message_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, handle TEXT NOT NULL, message TEXT NOT NULL)"
    g.message_db.execute(cmd)
    
    return g.message_db
```
What we did is to check whether there is a database called message_db in the g attribute of the webapp. If not, connect to that database and ensure that the connection is an attribute of g. Then, we check whether a table called messages is in message_db, if not, create one. Lastly, return the connection g.message_db.

**Secondly, we write a function called insert_message(request) to insert user messages(inputs) into the database of messages.**

```
def insert_message(request):
    # values of handle and message come from the user's input (request)
    handle = request.form['handle']
    message = request.form['message']

    # get the database connection and cursor
    db = get_message_db()
    cur = db.cursor()
    error = None

    if error is None:
        # message_id is the row length of the table in the database + 1
        cur.execute("SELECT * FROM messages")
        message_id = len(cur.fetchall())+1

        # insert new message_id, handle, and message values into the database table
        db.execute(
            'INSERT INTO messages (message_id, handle, message) VALUES (?, ?, ?)',
            (message_id, handle, message)
            )
        
        # it is necessary to run db.commit() to ensure that the row insertion has been saved
        db.commit()

        return redirect(url_for('main'))

    # close the connection
    db = g.pop('message_db', None)
    if db is not None:
        db.close()

    return render_template('base.html')
```

From the code above, we first specify each user inputs to different variables(handle, message). Then, we set message_id to the row length of the table in the database +1 in order to ensure the uniqueness. Followed by inserting all the variables into the database table. We utilize some sql command in these steps, by following the syntax above, you should have no problem dealing with the database. Finally, we should always commit the change and close the connection of the database.

**Next, we write a function called random_messages(n) to randomly choose n messages from the message_db. This function will be used when the user wants to view messages.**

```
def random_messages(n):
    # get the database connection and cursor
    db = get_message_db()
    cur = db.cursor()

    # randomly select n rows from the database
    cmd = "SELECT * from messages order by RANDOM() LIMIT ?"
    result = cur.execute(cmd, (n,))
    result = cur.fetchall()

    # close the connection
    db = g.pop('message_db', None)
    if db is not None:
        db.close()

    return result
```

In this function, we first get the database connection and cursor, then utilize the SQL command to extract data from them. The idea of the command line is to select the database table in a random order, then extract the first n row of the table. Again, always remeber to close the database connection in the end.

## ยง3. Render Templates

**In this session, I will show how to use render_template and how to write a html template.**

**We start by building the main page of the message bank.**

```
@app.route("/")
def main():
    return render_template("base.html")
```

We use render_template to generate output from a html file that is found in the application's templates folder.
In this case, we write our main page in a file called "base.html". 

*Here is how my main page looks like...*

**Next, we build the submit page.**

```
@app.route("/submit/", methods = ["POST", "GET"])
def submit():
    if request.method == "GET":
        return render_template("submit.html")
    else
        handle = request.form["handle"],
        message = request.form["message"]
        insert_message(request)
        return render_template("submit.html")
```

The url of the submit page is set to be {the main page url}/submit/ according to the first line of the code. The page supports both POST and GET methods. GET is used to request data from a specified resource, and POST is used to send data to a server to create/update a resource(database). In this case, when the user submit a message, the page would POST the user's input to the database. Hence, in the POST case, the function would simply render the submit.html template, whereas in the POST case, the function needs to save the inputs into variables, and insert them to the database.

**The source code of the corresponding submit.html template looks like this...**

```
<!doctype html>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ url_for('static', filename='style.css') }}">
  
{% block header %}
  <h1>{% block title %}Submit{% endblock %}</h1>
{% endblock %}

<body>
{% block content %}
  <form method="post">
      <label for="name">What is your name/handle?</label>
      <input type="text" name="handle" id="handle">
      <br>
      <label for="message">Please leave your message here.</label>
      <input type="text" name="message" id="message">
      <br>
      <input type="submit" value="Submit form">

  </form>
{% endblock %}

</body>
</html>
```
The first two lines is used to refer to the CSS static file. CSS describes how HTML elements should be displayed, and is used to change the style of the pages. As you can see, html can be written into different tags, for example, \<h1> refers to the heading and \<br> refers to next line. When escaping these tags, we should always remeber to add put something like \</h1> or \</br>. In the first line of the block content, we see \<form method="post">, this line tells the submit() function that request.method = post, and therefore should run the else statement. 

*Here is an example of a user submitting a message to the message bank system...*

**Lastly, we build the view page.**

```
@app.route("/view/")
def view():
    messages = random_messages(3)
    return render_template('view.html', db = messages)
```

Similar to submit(), the url of the view page is set to be {the main page url}/view/ as the first line of code implies. The page takes the result of random_messages(n) by setting n = 3, which means that it will randomly choose three user inputs and display them. 

**The source code of the corresponding view.html template looks like this...**

```
<!doctype html>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ url_for('static', filename='style.css') }}">

{% block header %}
  <h1>{% block title %}Message Bank{% endblock %}</h1>
{% endblock %}

<body>
{% block content %}
    <b>Here are some cool messages...</b>

  <p>
    {% for m in db %}
    {{m[2]}} 
    <br>
    - <i>{{m[1]}}</i>
  </p>
  {% endfor %}

{% endblock %}

</body>
</html>
```

Most codes are similar to the submit.html template. One thing to notice is that I utilize the looping and indexing techniques which Jinja tags support. Since the return type of random_messages(n) is a list containing n tuples, I first loop through the list, then use the index to get information I need from each tuple.
