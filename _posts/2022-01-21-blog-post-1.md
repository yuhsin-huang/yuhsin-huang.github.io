title: Blog Post 1 - Interactive Data Graphics
---
In this blog post, I will create several interactive data graphics using the NOAA climate data.

## §1. Create a Database

In this part, we will create a database containing three separate tables.
Databases is very useful when we need to deal with large data sets. It can store subsets of data into memory in an organized way, and help users easy to access.

With module called sqlite3 in Python, we can create, manipulate, and query databases. Additionally, there's also a pandas interface which allows us to create pandas data frames from our database.


**First, let's import some packages we will need for this blog post.**

```
import pandas as pd
import sqlite3
import numpy as np
from plotly import express as px
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
```

**Next, we will create a database into the current directory.**

```
conn = sqlite3.connect("temps.db") 
```

**Let's clean our data before adding them into the database.**

```
def prepare_df(df):
"""
prepare the temperature data
"""
    df = df.set_index(keys=["ID", "Year"])
    df = df.stack()
    df = df.reset_index()
    df = df.rename(columns = {"level_2"  : "Month" , 0 : "Temp"})
    df["Month"] = df["Month"].str[5:].astype(int)
    df["Temp"]  = df["Temp"] / 100
    return(df)

df = pd.read_csv("temps.csv")
df = prepare_df(df)
df.head()
```

**Now, we can add our data into our database.**

```
df_iter = pd.read_csv("temps.csv", chunksize = 100000)
for df in df_iter:
    df = prepare_df(df)
    df.to_sql("temperatures", conn, if_exists = "append", index = False)
```

*To explain what just happened, we first read in the data with chunksize 100000. Then, the df.to_sql() method writes it to a specified table in the database.*


**Next, we add the other two data tables into the database.**

```
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilChodrow/PIC16B/master/datasets/noaa-ghcn/station-metadata.csv"
stations = pd.read_csv(url)
stations.to_sql("stations", conn, if_exists = "replace", index = False)

countries_url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mysociety/gaze/master/data/fips-10-4-to-iso-country-codes.csv"
countries = pd.read_csv(countries_url)
countries = countries.drop(["ISO 3166"], axis = 1)
countries = countries.rename(columns = {"FIPS 10-4"  : "ID", "Name" : "Country"})
countries.to_sql("countries", conn, if_exists = "replace", index = False)
```

## §2. Write a Query Function

**In this part, I will show how to write a query function.**

```
def query_climate_database(country, year_begin, year_end, month):
    """
    a function that returns a Pandas dataframe of temperature readings for the specified country, in the 
    specified date range, and in the specified month of the year. The returned dataframe has columns of the 
    station name, the latitude of the station, the longitude of the station, the name of the country in 
    which the station is located, the year in which the reading was taken, the month in which the reading 
    was taken, and the average temperature at the specified station during the specified year and month.

    Arguements:
    country: a string giving the name of a country for which data should be returned
    year_begin: an integer specified the earliest year for which should be returned
    year_end: an integer specified the latest year for which should be returned
    month: an integer giving the month of the year for which should be returned

    Return:
    df: a Pandas dataframe of temperature readings for the specified country, in the specified date range, 
    and in the specified month of the year
    """
    
    # sql command to form the query
    cmd = \
        """
        SELECT S.NAME, S.LATITUDE, S.LONGITUDE, C.Country, T.Year, T.Month, T.Temp
        FROM temperatures T
        INNER JOIN countries C ON SUBSTR(T.id, 0, 3)=C.ID
        LEFT JOIN stations S ON T.id = S.id
        WHERE C.Country=? AND T.Year>=? AND T.Year<=? AND T.Month=?
        """
        
    # convert sql query to pandas dataframe
    df = pd.read_sql_query(cmd, conn, params = (country, year_begin, year_end, month))
    
    # drop duplicated rows
    df = df.drop_duplicates()
    
    return df

```
Let's break the code down a bit.

First, we need to understand the concept of cursor. Cursor is our primary way to interact with the database. The cursor executes SQL commands, so we need to use SQL in order to work with databases.

Now let's take a look at the command that we executed above.

- SELECT ... : These are the entries that will be shown in the returned dataframe
- FROM ... : the data comes from the temperature table
- INNER JOIN..., LEFT JOIN... : add the contries and stations table into the dataframe.
  Inner join the countries data if the first three letters of temperature[id] equals countries[ID], and left join the stations data if temperature[id] equals stations[id].
- WHERE... : if these conditions meet, the row of data will be included into the returned dataframe

After we have our SQL query, we convert it to pandas dataframe. In the code above, "params" specifies what the question marks in the command line are.


**Let's test our code!**
```
# Example
df1 = query_climate_database(country = "India", 
                       year_begin = 1980, 
                       year_end = 2020,
                       month = 1)
df1
```

Looks great!

## §3. Write a Geographic Scatter Function for Yearly Temperature Increases
**In this part, I will create a visualization that address the following question:** <br /> 
*How does the average yearly change in temperature vary within a given country?*

First, we create a function that compute the estimated yearly change in temperature using the linear regression model.

```
def coef(data_group):
    """
    Using the linear regression model to compute the estimated yearly change in temperature.
    
    Arguements:
    data_group: dataframe we are calculating
    
    Return:
    LR.coef_[0].round(4): the estimated yearly temperature change rounded to the fourth decimal place
    """
    
    x = data_group[["Year"]] # 2 brackets because X should be a df
    y = data_group["Temp"]   # 1 bracket because y should be a series
    LR = LinearRegression()
    LR.fit(x, y)
    return LR.coef_[0].round(4)
```

Then, we utilize the functions we created above to plot:
```
def temperature_coefficient_plot(country, year_begin, year_end, month, min_obs, **kwargs):
    """
    Create an interactive map showing the estimated yearly change in temperature.
    
    Arguements:
    country: a string giving the name of a country for which data should be returned
    year_begin: an integer specified the earliest year for which should be returned
    year_end: an integer specified the latest year for which should be returned
    month: an integer giving the month of the year for which should be returned
    min_obs: the minimum required number of years of data for any given station
    **kwargs: additional keyword arguments passed to px.scatter_mapbox()
    
    Return:
    fig: an interactive geographic scatterplot with a point for each station such that the color of the point 
    reflects an estimate of the yearly change in temperature during the specified month and time period at that 
    station. 
    """
    
    # Use the function we created above to construct a dataframe
    df = query_climate_database(country, year_begin, year_end, month)
    
    # Filter out data that does not meet the min_obs requirement
    df = df.groupby("NAME").filter(lambda x: len(x) >= min_obs)
    
    # calculate the estimated yearly temperature change using the linear regression model
    coefs = df.groupby(["NAME", "LATITUDE", "LONGITUDE"]).apply(coef)
    df1 = coefs.reset_index()
    
    # plot
    fig = px.scatter_mapbox(df1, 
                            lat = "LATITUDE",
                            lon = "LONGITUDE", 
                            hover_name = "NAME",
                            title = kwargs['title'],
                            color = kwargs['color'], 
                            zoom = kwargs['zoom'],
                            mapbox_style = kwargs['mapbox_style'], 
                            color_continuous_scale = kwargs['color_continuous_scale'])

    fig.update_layout(margin={"r":0,"t":30,"l":0,"b":0})
    fig.layout.coloraxis.colorbar.title = 'Estimated Yearly Increase (°C)'
    color_continuous_midpoint = 0
    return fig
```

Let's see if it works...
```
color_map = px.colors.diverging.RdGy_r 

temperature_coefficient_plot("India", 1980, 2020, 1, 
                              min_obs = 10,
                              title = "Estimated of Yearly Increase in Temperature in January for Stations in India, years 1980-2020",
                              color = 0,
                              zoom = 2,
                              mapbox_style="carto-positron",
                              color_continuous_scale=color_map)
```

Hooray!!!


## §4. Create Two More Interesting Figures
**I will present two more figures in this section.

### 1. Scatter Facet Plot - How does the average temperature vary over months and years within a given country?

Again, we create a function to query database in order to get the useful information we need for the graph.

```
def query_climate_database2(country, year_begin, year_end):
    """
    a function that returns a Pandas dataframe of the average temperature readings out of all the stations for 
    the specified country and in the specified year range. 
    
    Arguements:
    country: a string giving the name of a country for which data should be returned
    year_begin: an integer specified the earliest year for which should be returned
    year_end: an integer specified the latest year for which should be returned

    Return:
    df: a Pandas dataframe of of the average temperature readings out of all the stations for the specified 
    country and in the specified year range. 
    """
    
    # sql command to form the query
    cmd = \
        """
        SELECT S.NAME, C.Country, T.Year, T.Month, T.Temp
        FROM temperatures T
        INNER JOIN countries C ON SUBSTR(T.id, 0, 3)=C.ID
        LEFT JOIN stations S ON T.id = S.id
        WHERE C.Country=? AND T.Year>=? AND T.Year<=?
        """
        
    # convert sql query to pandas dataframe
    df = pd.read_sql_query(cmd, conn, params = (country, year_begin, year_end))
    
    # calculate the average temperature out of all the station data
    df['Mean (°C)'] = df.groupby(["Month", "Year"])["Temp"].transform(np.mean).round(4)
    
    # drop duplicated rows
    df = df.drop_duplicates()
    
    return df
 ```
 
Let's see how it worked...
```
# Example
df2 = query_climate_database2(country = "France", year_begin = 2010, year_end = 2020)
df2
```

Now, we plot the interactive graph.

```
def temperature_average_plot(country, year_begin, year_end, **kwargs):
    """

    year_end: an integer specified the latest year for which should be returned
    **kwargs: additional keyword arguments passed to px.scatter_mapbox()
    
    Return:
    fig: an interactive facet scatterplot with points representing average temperature out of all the stations 
    of the month and the year.
    """
    
    # Use the function we created to construct a dataframe
    df = query_climate_database2(country, year_begin, year_end)
    
    # plot
    fig = px.scatter(df, 
                     x="Year", 
                     y="Mean (°C)", 
                     color=kwargs['color'],
                     facet_col=kwargs['facet_col'],
                     category_orders=kwargs['category_orders'],
                     title=kwargs['title'])
    
    fig.layout.coloraxis.colorbar.title = 'Average Temp (°C)'
    color_continuous_midpoint = 0
    
    return fig
```

```
temperature_average_plot("France", 
                         2000, 
                         2010,
                         color='Mean (°C)', 
                         facet_col='Month', 
                         category_orders={"Month": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]},
                         title="Average Temperature Out of All Stations in France Over Months, Years 2000-2010")
```

### 2. Line Plot - How does the average temperature in a specified month vary over years and countries within a given latitude range?

```
def query_climate_database3(max_lat, min_lat, year_begin, year_end, month):
    """

        LEFT JOIN stations S ON T.id = S.id

    # convert sql query to pandas dataframe
    df = pd.read_sql_query(cmd, conn, params = (max_lat, min_lat, year_begin, year_end, month))
    
    # calculate temperature mean in each country
    df['Country Mean (°C)'] = df.groupby(["Country", "Year"])["Temp"].transform(np.mean).round(4)
    
    # sort values by year to avoid lines cycling around
    df = df.sort_values(by="Year")
    
    # drop duplicated rows
    df = df.drop_duplicates()
    
    return df
```

Test...
```
# Example
df3 = query_climate_database3(max_lat = 23.5, 
                              min_lat = -23.5, 
                              year_begin = 2010,
                              year_end = 2020,
                              month = 7)
df3
```

```

Lastly, always remeber to close the database connection!!

```
conn.close()
```
